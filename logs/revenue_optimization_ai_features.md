## AI Cost Management

```javascript
// Process multiple requests together
const batchOptimize = async (items) => {
  const batchPrompt = items.map(item => 
    `${item.type}: ${item.content}`
  ).join('\n---\n');
  
  // Single API call for multiple items
  // Reduces per-request overhead
};
```

## Conclusion

**The math works strongly in our favor:**

1. **AI adds massive value** while keeping costs minimal (1-3% of revenue)
2. **Premium pricing is justified** by tangible ROI for chambers
3. **Network effects create moats** that competitors can't easily replicate
4. **Margins remain excellent** (85-90%) even with AI costs

**Recommended immediate actions:**
1. Start with content optimization features (highest value, lowest cost)
2. Implement usage-based pricing tiers
3. Focus on demonstrable ROI for chambers
4. Build referral commission system for recurring revenue

**Key insight: Chambers will pay 3-5x more for features that help their members succeed.** AI enables us to deliver that value at minimal marginal cost, creating a scalable, high-margin business model.

The focus should be on rapid feature development and chamber acquisition, not cost optimization. The revenue potential far exceeds the infrastructure costs.
