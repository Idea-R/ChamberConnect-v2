   - Prototype key features
   - Test performance characteristics
   - Calculate exact migration costs

2. **Implement cost monitoring**
   - Track per-chamber costs
   - Monitor Stripe fee patterns
   - Set up cost alerts

### Phase 3: Scale (12-24 months)
1. **Execute chosen migration**
   - Gradual customer migration
   - A/B testing of solutions
   - Performance monitoring

2. **Optimize post-migration**
   - Fine-tune configurations

## Conclusion

**For ChamberConnect's current scale (1-5 chambers), Supabase remains the optimal choice** due to:
- Low total cost ($65-250/month including Stripe)
- Zero migration complexity
- Comprehensive feature set
- Strong developer experience

**Migration becomes attractive at 20+ chambers** when:
- Monthly database costs exceed $150
- Development team can dedicate 1-2 months to migration
- Long-term cost savings justify complexity

**Key insight: Stripe fees are consistent across all solutions** (~3% of revenue), making database hosting costs the primary differentiator. The focus should be on building revenue rather than optimizing hosting costs until reaching significant scale.

**Recommended action: Continue with Supabase** while building monitoring and abstraction layers that enable future migration when economically justified.
