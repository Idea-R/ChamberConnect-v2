## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Database Schema (Supabase)

```sql
-- Chambers table
CREATE TABLE chambers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  phone VARCHAR,
  email VARCHAR,
  website VARCHAR,
  logo_url VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Chamber admins table
CREATE TABLE chamber_admins (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  chamber_id UUID REFERENCES chambers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role VARCHAR DEFAULT 'admin',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Members table
CREATE TABLE members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  chamber_id UUID REFERENCES chambers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  business_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  contact_name VARCHAR,
  email VARCHAR,
  phone VARCHAR,
  address TEXT,
  website VARCHAR,
  category VARCHAR,
  description TEXT,
  logo_url VARCHAR,
  membership_status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'active',
  membership_type VARCHAR DEFAULT 'standard',
  joined_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
  renewal_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Events table
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  chamber_id UUID REFERENCES chambers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  event_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  location TEXT,
  max_attendees INTEGER,
  registration_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### AI Integration Architecture

```typescript
// AI Service Configuration
interface AIService {
  generateBusinessBio(businessInfo: BusinessInfo): Promise<string>;
  optimizeContent(content: string, type: 'bio' | 'description'): Promise<string>;
  generateSEOSuggestions(content: string): Promise<SEOSuggestion[]>;
}

// Implementation with OpenAI
class OpenAIService implements AIService {
  private client: OpenAI;
  
  constructor() {
    this.client = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    });
  }
  
  async generateBusinessBio(businessInfo: BusinessInfo): Promise<string> {
    const response = await this.client.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o-mini",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: "You are a professional business copywriter specializing in chamber of commerce member profiles."
        },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `Create a compelling business bio for: ${JSON.stringify(businessInfo)}`
        }
      ],
      max_tokens: 200,
      temperature: 0.7
    });
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content || '';
  }
}
```
